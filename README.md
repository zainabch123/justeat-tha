## Setting up
This project contains seperate **frontend** and **backend** directories. To run the app, open up your terminal and do as follows:

    2. Navigate to the projects directory: `cd projectname`
    3. Navigate to **backend** folder: `cd backend`
    4. Install dependencies: `npm install`
    5. In the **backend** folder change the `.env.example` file to `.env`
    6. Navigate to the **frontend** folder: `cd ../frontend`
    7. Install dependencies: `npm install`
    8. In the **frontend** folder change the `.env.evample` file to `.env`
    9. To run the **backend**, navigate to the backend folder with `cd ../backend`. Then run `npm start`. The backend server should start.
    10.   9. To run the **frontend**, navigate to the backend folder with `cd ../frontend`. Then run `npm run dev`. The frontend app should start.
    NOTE: You can edit the values of the port variables in the `.env` files as long as they are both changed to the same value. E.g. `VITE_PORT=4000` in the frontend and `PORT=4000` in the backend.
